#3d printer materials prediction
->Recently,Three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies have been widely applied in industry and our daily lives. Replacement and upgrading products have become increasingly
rapid in recent years and competitions in manufacturing leads to development of new technologies.
->Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a rapid prototyping process based on adding successive layers of material to create 3D objects under computer control. Working with a 
wide range of materials, along with the few limitations in the fabrication of complex geometries, have proven to be advantages of the 3D printing compared with 
conventional processes. This manufacturing process has been used in a wide variety of applications.
->The term 3D bioprinting has been coined to describe 3D printing. Machine learning is currently becoming increasingly active and has been used to improve 3D printing 
processes, such as process optimization, dimensional accuracy analysis, manufacturing defect detection, and material property prediction.  
->Machine Learning is an interdisciplinary subject which is a sub-field of AI and promotes a low-cost computing through algorithmic learning. Based on advantages of ML
methods, they have been used for different purposes in the field of 3D printing. ML was utilized for process monitoring of 3D printing. In this project, the input 
parameters are like :
•	Layer Height (mm),
•	Wall Thickness (mm), 
•	Infill Density (%), 
•	Infill Pattern (honeycomb, grid),
•	Nozzle Temperature (Cº), 
•	Bed Temperature (Cº), 
•	Print Speed(mm/s), 
•	Fan Speed (%), 
•	Roughness (µm),
